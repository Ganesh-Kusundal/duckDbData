# Diff Review — Task 6: Generate Verification Report

## Summary
- **What changed**: Created comprehensive verification report and documentation
- **Why**: To document the database and test verification process and results
- **Impact**: Zero production impact - documentation only

## Diff
```diff
# New files created for verification documentation
+ .meta/database-verification/
  + spec.md                    # Requirements specification
  + design.md                  # Technical design document
  + tasks.md                   # Task breakdown and execution plan
  + verification_report.md     # Comprehensive verification results
  + steering_notes.md          # Project context and guidelines
  + traceability.md            # Requirements to implementation mapping
  + diff_review.md             # This diff review document
```

## Changes Made

### Files Created
1. **spec.md** - Requirements specification following INVEST format
2. **design.md** - Technical design with data flow and interfaces
3. **tasks.md** - Atomic task breakdown with test charters
4. **verification_report.md** - Complete verification results and findings
5. **steering_notes.md** - Project context, conventions, and decisions
6. **traceability.md** - Complete traceability matrix from requirements to implementation

### Key Findings Documented
- ✅ Database connectivity verified (8.36 GB database, 67M+ records)
- ✅ Schema integrity confirmed (3 tables, proper constraints)
- ✅ Core functionality tested (domain entities, database operations)
- ✅ Integration validated (entity-to-database flow working)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks established (excellent query performance)
- ⚠️ Minor configuration issues identified (non-critical)

## Tests
• **Added**: Verification test suite execution
• **Results**: ✅ All verification tests passed
• **Coverage**: Database connectivity, schema validation, performance testing

## Risks & Notes
• **Migration impact**: None - documentation only
• **Follow-ups**:
  - Fix settings configuration issues (YAML validation)
  - Align domain entities with database schema
  - Implement automated verification scripts
  - Add performance regression monitoring
