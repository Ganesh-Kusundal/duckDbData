# Feature Specification â€” Database and Test Verification

## Problem Statement
The DuckDB financial data system needs verification that the database is operational and all test suites are functioning correctly to ensure system reliability and data integrity.

## Scope
- In Scope:
  - Verify DuckDB database connectivity and schema integrity
  - Validate existing test infrastructure and fixtures
  - Test core database operations (CRUD, queries, connections)
  - Verify test execution and results
  - Check data integrity and constraints
  - Validate performance and error handling
- Out of Scope:
  - Database schema modifications or migrations
  - New test case development
  - Performance optimization beyond verification
  - External API integrations testing

## User Personas
- **Developer**: Needs to ensure the system is working before development
- **QA Engineer**: Needs to validate test infrastructure before test execution
- **DevOps Engineer**: Needs to verify database health and connectivity

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to verify the database is accessible and contains valid data, so that I can proceed with development confidently.
- As a QA engineer, I want to ensure all test fixtures are working correctly, so that test results are reliable.
- As a system administrator, I want to validate database connectivity and performance, so that I can monitor system health.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given the DuckDB database exists, When I attempt to connect, Then the connection should succeed and show proper schema.
- Given valid database credentials, When I query the main tables, Then I should receive expected data with correct structure.
- Given the test suite, When I run core tests, Then they should pass with no critical failures.
- Given the database contains market data, When I validate data integrity, Then all constraints and relationships should be maintained.
- Given the test fixtures, When I load them, Then they should provide valid test data without errors.

## Constraints
- Performance: Database verification should complete within 5 minutes
- Security: No sensitive data should be exposed in logs or outputs
- Compatibility: Must work with existing DuckDB version and test framework
