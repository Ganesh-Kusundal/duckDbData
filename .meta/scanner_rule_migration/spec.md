# Feature Specification â€” Scanner Rule-Based Migration

## Problem Statement
The current scanner infrastructure consists of multiple separate Python files (breakout_scanner.py, crp_scanner.py, etc.) with hardcoded logic, making it difficult to add new scanners, modify existing logic, or maintain consistency. Each scanner has its own SQL queries, business logic, and parameter handling, leading to code duplication and maintenance overhead. We need to migrate this to a unified rule-based system using JSON definitions that can be dynamically loaded and executed against the database.

## Scope
- In Scope:
  - Design comprehensive JSON rule schema supporting all scanner types
  - Create unified rule engine that replaces individual scanner implementations
  - Migrate breakout, CRP, and technical scanners to rule-based system
  - Implement rule validation, testing, and performance monitoring
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing scanner interfaces
  - Provide rule management tools (create, update, disable, monitor)

- Out of Scope:
  - Database schema modifications
  - External API integrations
  - Real-time streaming data processing
  - Advanced machine learning rule optimization
  - Third-party scanner platform integrations

## User Personas
- **Trading Strategist**: Needs flexible rule creation without coding knowledge
- **Quant Developer**: Requires programmatic rule management and testing
- **Risk Manager**: Needs rule validation and performance monitoring
- **System Administrator**: Requires rule deployment and maintenance tools
- **Data Analyst**: Needs rule execution analytics and reporting

## User Stories
- As a Trading Strategist, I want to create new trading rules in JSON so that I can test strategies without developer help
- As a Quant Developer, I want to programmatically manage rules so that I can automate strategy testing and optimization
- As a Risk Manager, I want to validate rules before deployment so that I can ensure trading compliance and risk limits
- As a System Administrator, I want to monitor rule performance so that I can identify and fix underperforming rules
- As a Data Analyst, I want to analyze rule execution patterns so that I can improve strategy effectiveness

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given a JSON rule definition, When the rule engine processes it, Then it executes the rule logic correctly against the database
- Given multiple rule types exist, When rules are loaded, Then all rule types are properly instantiated and validated
- Given a trading scenario exists, When rules are evaluated, Then appropriate signals are generated with correct confidence scores
- Given rules are executed, When performance is monitored, Then execution metrics and success rates are tracked
- Given rule definitions change, When rules are reloaded, Then changes take effect without system restart
- Given invalid rule syntax exists, When rules are validated, Then clear error messages are provided with suggestions

## Constraints
- Performance: Rule execution must maintain sub-second response times for real-time trading
- Scalability: System must handle 100+ concurrent rules without performance degradation
- Reliability: Rule execution failures must not crash the entire system
- Security: Rule definitions must be validated to prevent malicious code execution
- Compatibility: Must maintain existing scanner API interfaces during transition
- Testing: 100% test coverage for rule engine and validation components
