# Task Plan â€” Scanner Rule-Based Migration

## Task 1: Design Rule Schema Architecture
- **Goal:** Create comprehensive JSON schema supporting all scanner types
- **Changes:** Design rule schema, validation framework, and type system
- **Tests:** Unit tests for schema validation and type checking
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_rule_schema.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** All rule types properly defined with validation
- **Risks:** Schema changes breaking existing rule definitions

## Task 2: Create Rule Engine Core
- **Goal:** Build unified rule engine with dynamic execution
- **Changes:** Implement RuleEngine class, query builders, and execution pipeline
- **Tests:** Integration tests for rule execution pipeline
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_rule_engine.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Engine can execute all rule types successfully
- **Risks:** Performance bottlenecks in query generation

## Task 3: Implement Rule Persistence Layer
- **Goal:** Create rule storage, loading, and management system
- **Changes:** Database schema for rules, file system integration, rule versioning
- **Tests:** CRUD operations tests for rule management
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_rule_persistence.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Rules can be stored, loaded, and versioned
- **Risks:** Data corruption during rule updates

## Task 4: Migrate Breakout Scanner to Rules
- **Goal:** Convert BreakoutScanner to rule-based implementation
- **Changes:** Extract breakout logic into JSON rules, create breakout rule templates
- **Tests:** Compare rule-based vs original implementation results
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_breakout_migration.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Rule-based breakout scanner produces identical results
- **Risks:** Logic translation errors in rule conversion

## Task 5: Migrate CRP Scanner to Rules
- **Goal:** Convert CRPScanner to rule-based implementation
- **Changes:** Extract CRP logic into JSON rules, create CRP rule templates
- **Tests:** Validate CRP rule execution against original implementation
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_crp_migration.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Rule-based CRP scanner produces identical results
- **Risks:** Complex CRP conditions translation issues

## Task 6: Implement Rule Validation Framework
- **Goal:** Create comprehensive rule validation and testing system
- **Changes:** Syntax validation, semantic checking, performance validation
- **Tests:** Validation framework tests and rule quality checks
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_rule_validation.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** All rules pass validation framework
- **Risks:** False positives in validation logic

## Task 7: Create Rule Management Tools
- **Goal:** Build tools for rule creation, editing, and monitoring
- **Changes:** CLI tools, web interface components, rule analytics dashboard
- **Tests:** Tool functionality and user interface tests
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_rule_management.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Users can manage rules through provided tools
- **Risks:** Complex UI/UX requirements

## Task 8: Implement Performance Monitoring
- **Goal:** Add comprehensive rule performance tracking
- **Changes:** Execution metrics, success rate tracking, performance analytics
- **Tests:** Monitoring system integration tests
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_performance_monitoring.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** All rule executions are monitored and reported
- **Risks:** Performance overhead from monitoring

## Task 9: Create Backward Compatibility Layer
- **Goal:** Maintain existing scanner API compatibility
- **Changes:** Wrapper classes, adapter patterns, migration utilities
- **Tests:** Compatibility tests with existing scanner interfaces
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_backward_compatibility.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Existing code continues to work unchanged
- **Risks:** Breaking changes during migration

## Task 10: Execute Comprehensive Testing
- **Goal:** Validate complete rule-based system functionality
- **Changes:** End-to-end testing, performance benchmarking, stress testing
- **Tests:** Full system integration tests and performance benchmarks
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/ --cov=rules --cov-report=html`
- **Exit Criteria:** 100% test coverage and performance benchmarks met
- **Risks:** Integration issues between components

## Task 11: Create Migration Documentation
- **Goal:** Document migration process and best practices
- **Changes:** Migration guides, rule authoring documentation, troubleshooting
- **Tests:** Documentation validation and example verification
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/docs/test_migration_docs.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Complete documentation for rule-based migration
- **Risks:** Documentation becoming outdated

## Task 12: Implement Rule Deployment Pipeline
- **Goal:** Create automated rule deployment and rollback system
- **Changes:** Deployment scripts, rollback mechanisms, environment management
- **Tests:** Deployment pipeline tests and rollback verification
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/rules/test_deployment_pipeline.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Rules can be deployed and rolled back safely
- **Risks:** Production deployment failures
