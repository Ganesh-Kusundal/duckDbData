# Feature Specification â€” Data Verification and Integration

## Problem Statement
The financial data system requires robust data verification and integration capabilities to ensure data integrity across the analytics and src modules. Currently, there are separate data access patterns in analytics/ and src/ directories that need to be unified and thoroughly tested without using mocking, ensuring real-world data validation and system reliability.

## Scope
- In Scope:
  - Verify database connectivity and schema integrity across analytics and src modules
  - Implement unified data access patterns between DuckDBAnalytics and DuckDBAdapter
  - Create comprehensive data validation pipeline without mocking
  - Integrate analytics queries with domain entities and repositories
  - Establish real-time data verification capabilities
  - Implement cross-module data consistency checks
  - Create unified testing framework for data operations
  - Validate parquet file integration and performance
  - Establish data quality metrics and monitoring
  - Implement data synchronization verification

- Out of Scope:
  - Database schema modifications or migrations
  - External API integrations testing
  - UI/dashboard functionality testing
  - Network connectivity testing
  - Performance benchmarking beyond basic validation

## User Personas
- **Data Engineer**: Needs to ensure data flows correctly between analytics and domain layers
- **QA Engineer**: Needs comprehensive validation of data operations without mocks
- **System Architect**: Needs to verify integration patterns and data consistency
- **DevOps Engineer**: Needs automated verification of database health and connectivity

## User Stories
- As a data engineer, I want to verify that analytics queries work with real domain entities, so that I can trust the data transformations
- As a QA engineer, I want to validate data integrity across all modules using real data, so that I can ensure system reliability
- As a system architect, I want to verify unified data access patterns, so that I can maintain consistent architecture
- As a DevOps engineer, I want automated health checks for database operations, so that I can monitor system status

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given the analytics module, When I run data queries, Then they should integrate seamlessly with domain repositories
- Given real database connections, When I execute cross-module operations, Then data consistency should be maintained
- Given the validation pipeline, When I run comprehensive checks, Then all data integrity rules should pass
- Given parquet files and database tables, When I query unified views, Then results should be consistent
- Given the analytics dashboard, When I access data, Then it should use the same domain entities as the src modules
- Given database operations, When I perform CRUD operations, Then they should work across both analytics and src patterns
- Given the system, When I run integration tests, Then all tests should pass with real data and connections
- Given data validation, When I check schema integrity, Then all required fields should be present and valid

## Constraints
- Performance: Data verification should complete within 10 minutes for comprehensive checks
- Security: No sensitive data should be exposed in logs or test outputs
- Compatibility: Must work with existing DuckDB database and parquet file structures
- Reliability: All operations must handle connection failures gracefully
- Testing: No mocking allowed - all tests must use real data and connections
- Data Safety: Operations should be read-only for verification, write operations must be isolated
