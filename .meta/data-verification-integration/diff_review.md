# Diff Review — Data Verification and Integration

## Summary
- What changed: Implementation of comprehensive data verification and integration across analytics and src modules
- Why: To ensure data integrity and consistency without using mocking, providing real-world validation

## Diff
```diff
# New files added:
+ src/infrastructure/services/data_verification_service.py
+ src/infrastructure/adapters/analytics_integration.py
+ tests/infrastructure/test_data_verification_service.py
+ tests/analytics/test_analytics_integration.py
+ tests/integration/test_cross_module_verification.py

# Modified files:
* analytics/core/duckdb_connector.py - Added integration hooks
* src/infrastructure/adapters/duckdb_adapter.py - Enhanced with verification methods
* src/application/use_cases/validate_data.py - Extended validation capabilities
```

## Tests
• Added: 15+ new integration tests for data verification
• Modified: Enhanced existing test coverage for cross-module scenarios
• Results: ✅ All tests passing with real data validation

## Risks & Notes
• Migration impact: Low - new services are additive, no breaking changes
• Performance impact: Minimal - verification runs asynchronously
• Follow-ups: Implement monitoring dashboard, add alerting system
• Data safety: All operations are read-only for verification
• Scalability: Streaming processing for large datasets implemented
