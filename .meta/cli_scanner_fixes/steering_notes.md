# Steering Notes - CLI Scanner Fixes & Integration

## Coding Conventions
- snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes
- Type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types
- Clear, descriptive variable and function names

## Tech Choices
- Database: DuckDB with connection pooling for performance
- CLI Framework: Click for command-line interface
- Logging: Python logging with structured format
- Testing: pytest with real data integration tests

## Do / Don't Rules
- ✅ Always use real database data, never mock data
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully with clear user messages
- ✅ Log all important operations for debugging
- ✅ Validate inputs before processing
- ❌ Don't use DataFrames for CLI result processing
- ❌ Don't hardcode database connection parameters
- ❌ Don't suppress errors without proper handling

## Glossary
- Signal: Trading signal generated by scanner with confidence score
- Rule Engine: Core component that executes trading rules against data
- Scanner Mapper: Component that maps scanner logic to rule execution
- Connection Pool: Database connection management for performance

## Open Decisions
- [ ] How to handle database lock conflicts in production
- [ ] Whether to implement result caching for performance
- [ ] How to handle very large result sets (>1M rows)
- [ ] Whether to add progress bars for long-running queries
