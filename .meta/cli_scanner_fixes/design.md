# Technical Design â€” CLI Scanner Fixes & Integration

## Architecture Context
The CLI scanner system integrates multiple components: CLI interface, rule engine, database layer, and scanner mappers. The current issues stem from improper data type handling and incomplete database integration in the execution pipeline.

## Data Flow
1. Input: CLI command with parameters (scanner_type, date, time filters, output format)
2. Processing:
   - Parameter validation and type conversion
   - Scanner factory initialization with rule-based scanners
   - Rule engine execution with database queries
   - Result processing and formatting
3. Output: Formatted scanner results with trading signals

## Interfaces
- Function: `get_scanner(name: str, db_path: str) -> Scanner`
- Function: `RuleEngine.execute_rule(rule_id: str, scan_date: date, **kwargs) -> Dict`
- CLI Command: `python cli.py scanners run --scanner-type <type> --date <date>`
- Database: DuckDB connection with query execution and result processing

## Database Schema
- Table `market_data`: symbol, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume, date_partition
- No schema changes required - using existing tables

## Error Handling
- Time conversion errors: Return clear error message with expected format
- Database connection errors: Graceful fallback with retry logic
- Query execution errors: Detailed logging with query and parameters
- Import errors: Clear module loading error messages
- Result processing errors: Validation of result structure before processing

## Observability
- Logs: Debug level for query execution, Info level for scanner progress, Error level for failures
- Metrics: Query execution time, signal generation count, error rates
- Tracing: Rule execution flow with context tracking

## Performance Notes
- Complexity: O(n) where n is number of database rows processed
- Caching: Query result caching for repeated executions
- Connection pooling: Reuse database connections to reduce overhead
- Memory usage: Stream processing for large result sets to avoid memory issues
