## User Stories Legend
- **US-01**: As a quant trader, I want real-time Dhan API integration so that I can execute trades in live markets
- **US-02**: As a risk manager, I want automated position monitoring and risk limits so that I can prevent excessive losses
- **US-03**: As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery so that the system remains stable during market hours
- **US-04**: As a data scientist, I want complete telemetry data so that I can analyze and improve trading strategies
- **US-05**: As a trader, I want scanner integration so that signals are automatically processed and executed
- **US-06**: As a risk officer, I want enhanced risk controls for live trading so that losses are contained within acceptable limits
- **US-07**: As a system operator, I want high reliability so that trading continues uninterrupted during market hours

## Acceptance Criteria Legend
- **AC-01**: Given live market conditions, When the system receives signals, Then it should execute orders through Dhan API within 500ms
- **AC-02**: Given authentication failures, When token expires, Then system should automatically re-authenticate
- **AC-03**: Given position changes, When fills occur, Then positions should be updated in real-time
- **AC-04**: Given risk limits exceeded, When new signals arrive, Then system should reject orders automatically
- **AC-05**: Given system failures, When errors occur, Then system should recover automatically within 30 seconds
- **AC-06**: Given partial failures, When components fail, Then system should continue operating degraded mode
- **AC-07**: Given trading activity, When orders execute, Then comprehensive metrics should be collected
- **AC-08**: Given system operation, When components run, Then health status should be continuously monitored
- **AC-09**: Given scanner signals, When signals arrive, Then they should be properly parsed and validated
- **AC-10**: Given valid signals, When processed, Then complete flow from signal to execution should work
- **AC-11**: Given position signals, When sizing calculated, Then all risk parameters should be validated
- **AC-12**: Given drawdown thresholds, When exceeded, Then positions should be automatically reduced
- **AC-13**: Given connection loss, When WebSocket disconnects, Then automatic reconnection should occur
- **AC-14**: Given order placement, When orders submitted, Then status should be tracked until completion

## Implementation Status
- **Planning Phase**: All tasks defined with detailed specifications
- **Ready for Development**: Architecture and interfaces designed
- **Validation Strategy**: Real data testing approach established
- **Risk Assessment**: Critical failure scenarios identified and mitigated
