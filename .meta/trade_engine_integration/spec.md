# Feature Specification â€” Trade Engine DuckDB Integration & Scanner Implementation

## Problem Statement
The current trade engine has a solid backtesting foundation but lacks proper DuckDB integration for efficient data access and scanner integration for algorithm implementation. The system needs enhanced data access patterns using actual DuckDB market data, with seamless integration with the scanner infrastructure for implementing trading algorithms. The focus is on efficient data retrieval for backtesting and algorithm development, not analytics pattern analysis.

## Scope
- **In Scope:**
  - DuckDB integration for efficient market data access and querying
  - Scanner integration for algorithm implementation and signal generation
  - Data feed enhancements using DuckDB Parquet scanning for backtesting
  - Comprehensive validation using actual DuckDB market data (no synthetic data)
  - Performance optimization for data access patterns (<2s query performance)
  - Error handling for database operations and data access
  - End-to-end testing with real DuckDB data flows (backtest mode only)

- **Out of Scope:**
  - Strategy algorithm changes (Top-3 Concentrate & Pyramid remains)
  - Database schema modifications (existing DuckDB structure adequate)
  - Frontend/dashboard development (separate concern)
  - Live broker integration (Dhan API - future phase)
  - Analytics pattern analysis and confidence scoring
  - Complex rule engine integration

## User Personas
- **Quant Trader**: Needs efficient data access for backtesting and algorithm development
- **Algorithm Developer**: Requires scanner integration for implementing trading strategies
- **Backtest Engineer**: Needs optimized data retrieval for testing trading algorithms
- **System Administrator**: Requires robust error handling and performance monitoring
- **Data Engineer**: Needs reliable database connectivity and query performance

## User Stories
- As a quant trader, I want efficient DuckDB data access so that I can run fast backtests on historical market data
- As an algorithm developer, I want scanner integration so that I can implement and test trading algorithms
- As a backtest engineer, I want optimized data queries so that I can process large datasets efficiently
- As a system administrator, I want reliable database connections so that the system operates consistently
- As a data engineer, I want proper error handling so that data access issues are managed gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given DuckDB database, When trade engine connects, Then it should establish reliable connection using unified manager
- Given market data queries, When executed for backtesting, Then queries should complete within 2 seconds for reasonable datasets
- Given scanner integration, When algorithms are implemented, Then signals should be generated and processed correctly
- Given data access patterns, When optimized for backtesting, Then memory usage and performance should be efficient
- Given database operations, When errors occur, Then proper error handling and recovery should be implemented
- Given backtest execution, When running with real data, Then complete workflow from data access to results should work
- Given scanner signals, When processed through strategy, Then integration should maintain existing trading logic

## Constraints
- **Performance**: DuckDB queries <2s for backtesting datasets, data access optimized for trading algorithms
- **Reliability**: System uptime > 99.5% during backtesting operations
- **Data Integrity**: No synthetic/mock data - all validation uses actual DuckDB market data with Parquet scanning
- **Database Integration**: Use UnifiedDuckDBManager for consistent connection handling
- **Scanner Integration**: Maintain compatibility with existing scanner infrastructure
- **Backtesting Focus**: All validation through backtest mode using real historical data
