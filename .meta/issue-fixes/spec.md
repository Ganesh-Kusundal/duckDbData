# Feature Specification â€” Fix Minor Issues

## Problem Statement
The DuckDB financial data system has minor configuration and schema alignment issues that prevent full settings import and create integration complexity, though core functionality remains intact.

## Scope
- In Scope:
  - Fix settings configuration YAML validation issues
  - Align domain entities with actual database schema
  - Ensure proper import paths and dependencies
  - Maintain backward compatibility
  - Preserve existing functionality
- Out of Scope:
  - Major schema changes or migrations
  - Breaking changes to existing APIs
  - Performance optimizations
  - New feature development

## User Personas
- **Developer**: Needs clean, working configuration system for development
- **System Administrator**: Needs consistent schema alignment for maintenance
- **QA Engineer**: Needs reliable imports for testing infrastructure

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want proper settings configuration so that the system loads correctly without import errors.
- As a system administrator, I want aligned schemas so that domain entities match database structure consistently.
- As a QA engineer, I want reliable imports so that test infrastructure works without configuration issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given the settings system, When importing configuration, Then all YAML files should validate correctly without errors.
- Given domain entities, When mapping to database schema, Then all fields should align with actual table structure.
- Given the import system, When loading modules, Then all dependencies should resolve correctly.
- Given the configuration changes, When running existing tests, Then all tests should continue to pass.
- Given the schema alignment, When performing CRUD operations, Then all entity-database mappings should work seamlessly.

## Constraints
- Performance: Fixes should not impact existing performance benchmarks
- Compatibility: Must maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Testing: All existing tests must continue to pass
- Documentation: Changes should be well-documented for maintenance
