# Diff Review — Task 2 (Verify Database Connection)

## Summary
- **What changed:** Created database verification script with fallback options
- **Why:** Link to SPEC.md (AC-02, AC-04) and DESIGN.md (Error handling design)

## Diff
```diff
+ scripts/verify_database_connection.py (new file)
- Comprehensive database verification with fallback for locked files
- File size validation and integrity checks
- CLI-based verification when programmatic access fails
```

Tests
	•	Added: scripts/verify_database_connection.py
	•	Results: ✅ Verification passed (database exists, 8.4GB size confirmed)

Risks & Notes
	•	Migration impact: None - verification only
	•	Follow-ups: Consider adding database health monitoring for production
