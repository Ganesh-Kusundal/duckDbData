# Feature Specification â€” DuckDB Integration & Scanner Verification

## Problem Statement
The project currently has fragmented database connections and scanner implementations. We need to unify all database operations to use only `data/financial_data.duckdb` and ensure all scanners work correctly with comprehensive test coverage.

## Scope
- In Scope:
  - Unify all database connections to use `data/financial_data.duckdb` exclusively
  - Verify all scanner implementations work correctly
  - Adopt and run all existing tests
  - Update configuration to point to single database
  - Implement proper error handling for database connections
  - Ensure scanner results are properly persisted

- Out of Scope:
  - Creating new scanners
  - Modifying existing scanner business logic
  - Database schema changes
  - External API integrations

## User Personas
- **Data Analyst**: Needs reliable access to market data through unified database
- **Scanner Developer**: Needs verified scanner implementations for trading signals
- **System Administrator**: Needs single database management and monitoring
- **Trading System**: Needs consistent data access for automated trading

## User Stories
- As a Data Analyst, I want all queries to use the unified database so that I get consistent results
- As a Scanner Developer, I want verified scanner implementations so that I can trust the trading signals
- As a System Administrator, I want single database management so that maintenance is simplified
- As a Trading System, I want reliable database connections so that trades execute correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given the system is configured, When any component accesses database, Then it uses `data/financial_data.duckdb`
- Given scanner implementations exist, When scanners are executed, Then they produce valid results
- Given tests are available, When test suite runs, Then all tests pass
- Given database connection fails, When error occurs, Then proper error handling is implemented
- Given scanner results are generated, When results are saved, Then they persist correctly

## Constraints
- Performance: Database operations must handle 8.4GB data efficiently
- Compliance: No external database dependencies allowed
- Compatibility: Must work with existing scanner interfaces
- Reliability: Zero data loss during integration
- Testing: 100% test coverage for integration components
