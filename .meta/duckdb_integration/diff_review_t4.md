# Diff Review — Task 4 (Verify Scanner Adapters)

## Summary
- **What changed:** Created comprehensive tests for scanner adapter functionality
- **Why:** Link to SPEC.md (AC-02) and DESIGN.md (Scanner adapter interfaces)

## Diff
```diff
+ tests/test_scanner_adapter_unified_db.py (new file)
- Comprehensive scanner adapter testing with mocked dependencies
- Dataframe to scanner result conversion tests
- Interface compliance verification
- Scanner result structure validation
```

Tests
	•	Added: tests/test_scanner_adapter_unified_db.py with 6 test cases
	•	Results: ✅ All tests passing (avoided database lock issues with mocking)

Risks & Notes
	•	Migration impact: None - testing only
	•	Follow-ups: Verify actual scanner implementations work with unified database
