# Feature Specification â€” Scanner Integration with Unified DuckDB Layer

## Problem Statement
The scanner system currently uses the old DuckDB adapter pattern with direct connections and manual resource management, creating inefficiencies and maintenance complexity. The scanner API, adapters, and strategies need to be migrated to use the new unified DuckDB layer for consistent performance, resource management, and error handling.

## Scope
- In Scope:
  - Migrate scanner_read_adapter.py to use UnifiedDuckDBManager
  - Update scanner API routes to leverage unified connection pooling
  - Refactor scanner strategies (CRP, Breakout, etc.) to use unified query interface
  - Update scanner configuration to work with unified layer settings
  - Create comprehensive integration tests for scanner + unified layer
  - Ensure backward compatibility during migration
  - Performance benchmarking and optimization

- Out of Scope:
  - Changing scanner business logic or algorithms
  - Modifying scanner API endpoints (only internal implementation)
  - External integrations (broker APIs, external data sources)
  - Scanner UI/frontend changes

## User Personas
- **Data Analyst**: Needs fast, reliable scanner queries without performance degradation
- **System Administrator**: Requires consistent resource usage and monitoring across all database operations
- **Developer**: Wants clean, maintainable scanner code with unified error handling
- **DevOps Engineer**: Needs centralized configuration and deployment consistency

## User Stories
- As a data analyst, I want scanner queries to use the unified connection pool so that I get consistent performance and resource efficiency.
- As a system administrator, I want all scanner database operations to be monitored through the unified layer so that I can track usage and optimize resources.
- As a developer, I want scanner adapters to use the unified error handling so that I get consistent error reporting and debugging information.
- As a DevOps engineer, I want scanner configuration to be centralized so that I can manage settings across all environments consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given scanner operations are executed, When using the unified layer, Then they share the same connection pool as other database operations.
- Given scanner queries fail, When using the unified layer, Then consistent error handling and logging occurs.
- Given scanner configuration is updated, When using unified layer, Then changes are applied automatically without restart.
- Given scanner performance is measured, When comparing old vs new implementation, Then performance improves by at least 15%.
- Given scanner integration is complete, When all tests pass, Then no breaking changes exist in scanner functionality.
- Given concurrent scanner operations, When using unified layer, Then thread safety is maintained without deadlocks.

## Constraints
- Performance: Must maintain or improve current scanner query performance
- Compatibility: Must support all existing scanner features and configurations
- Threading: Must be thread-safe for concurrent scanner operations
- Memory: Scanner operations should not impact unified layer memory usage
- Backward Compatibility: Existing scanner code should continue to work during migration
