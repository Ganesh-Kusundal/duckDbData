## User Stories Details

### US-01: Unified Scanner Performance
**As a** data analyst
**I want** scanner queries to use the unified connection pool
**So that** I get consistent performance and resource efficiency

### US-02: Consistent Scanner Monitoring
**As a** system administrator
**I want** all scanner database operations to be monitored through the unified layer
**So that** I can track usage and optimize resources

### US-03: Unified Scanner Error Handling
**As a** developer
**I want** scanner adapters to use the unified error handling
**So that** I get consistent error reporting and debugging information

### US-04: Centralized Scanner Configuration
**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** scanner configuration to be centralized
**So that** I can manage settings across all environments consistently

### US-05: Scanner Backward Compatibility
**As a** developer
**I want** existing scanner code to continue working
**So that** I can migrate gradually without breaking changes

### US-06: Scanner Performance Improvement
**As a** data analyst
**I want** scanner performance to improve with unified layer
**So that** I can get faster results for time-sensitive analysis

### US-07: Thread-Safe Scanner Operations
**As a** system administrator
**I want** concurrent scanner operations to be thread-safe
**So that** multiple users can run scanners simultaneously without issues

## Acceptance Criteria Details

### AC-01: Unified Connection Pool Usage
- Given scanner operations are executed
- When using the unified layer
- Then they share the same connection pool as other database operations

### AC-02: Unified Monitoring Integration
- Given scanner queries are executed
- When using the unified layer
- Then operations are tracked in unified monitoring system

### AC-03: Consistent Error Handling
- Given scanner queries fail
- When using the unified layer
- Then consistent error handling and logging occurs

### AC-04: Configuration Inheritance
- Given scanner configuration is updated
- When using unified layer
- Then changes are applied automatically without restart

### AC-05: Backward Compatibility Maintained
- Given existing scanner code exists
- When migrated to unified layer
- Then no breaking changes exist in scanner functionality

### AC-06: Performance Improvement Demonstrated
- Given scanner performance is measured
- When comparing old vs new implementation
- Then performance improves by at least 15%

### AC-07: Thread Safety Maintained
- Given concurrent scanner operations
- When using unified layer
- Then thread safety is maintained without deadlocks

## Test Coverage Summary
- **Unit Tests**: 90% coverage of unified scanner adapter components
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of scanner operations with unified layer
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking scanner queries with unified layer
- **Compatibility Tests**: Ensuring existing scanner code continues to work
- **Concurrency Tests**: Testing scanner operations under concurrent load
