# Task Plan â€” DuckDB Performance Optimization

## Task 1: Create Fast Mode Configuration
- **Goal:** Establish configuration system to toggle between fast and standard modes
- **Changes:** Add performance mode settings to config files
- **Tests:** Unit tests for configuration loading and mode detection
- **Commands:** `pytest tests/infrastructure/test_config_performance_mode.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Configuration loads correctly and mode detection works
- **Risks:** Breaking existing configuration loading

## Task 2: Implement Connection Pooling
- **Goal:** Create connection pool to reuse database connections and eliminate connection overhead
- **Changes:** New FastDuckDBConnector class with connection pooling
- **Tests:** Integration tests for connection pool creation, reuse, and cleanup
- **Commands:** `pytest tests/infrastructure/test_connection_pool.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Connection time reduced from 0.008s to <0.001s
- **Risks:** Memory leaks if connections not properly cleaned up

## Task 3: Simplify Verification Checks
- **Goal:** Create lightweight verification that skips complex schema validation
- **Changes:** New FastVerificationService with essential checks only
- **Tests:** Performance tests comparing fast vs standard verification
- **Commands:** `pytest tests/infrastructure/test_fast_verification.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Verification time reduced from 2.5s to <0.3s
- **Risks:** Missing critical validation in fast mode

## Task 4: Optimize Query Execution
- **Goal:** Implement query optimization patterns for faster execution
- **Changes:** Add query caching and prepared statement reuse
- **Tests:** Benchmark tests for query execution performance
- **Commands:** `pytest tests/analytics/test_query_performance.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Query execution 2x faster than baseline
- **Risks:** Query result caching may return stale data

## Task 5: Add Performance Monitoring
- **Goal:** Track performance improvements and detect regressions
- **Changes:** Performance metrics collection and alerting
- **Tests:** Integration tests for metrics collection
- **Commands:** `pytest tests/infrastructure/test_performance_monitoring.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** Performance metrics accurately collected and reported
- **Risks:** Performance overhead from monitoring itself

## Task 6: Update CLI Commands
- **Goal:** Add fast mode options to existing CLI commands
- **Changes:** Update CLI interfaces to support performance mode flags
- **Tests:** End-to-end tests for CLI performance mode
- **Commands:** `pytest tests/cli/test_performance_cli.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** CLI commands execute 3x faster in fast mode
- **Risks:** Breaking changes to CLI interface

## Task 7: Integration Testing
- **Goal:** Ensure optimized components work together seamlessly
- **Changes:** Integration tests combining all optimized components
- **Tests:** Full system integration tests with performance benchmarks
- **Commands:** `pytest tests/integration/test_performance_integration.py`
- **Exit Criteria:** All acceptance criteria from SPEC.md met
- **Risks:** Integration issues between optimized components
