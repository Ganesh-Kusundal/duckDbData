Defines scanning rules and strategies:
- Rule logic with conditions and actions
- Performance metrics and backtesting results
- Rule lifecycle management (Active, Inactive, Deprecated)
- Tagging and categorization
- Execution statistics and optimization

#### Signal
Represents trading signals generated by scans:
- Signal types (BUY, SELL, HOLD)
- Confidence levels and strength ratings
- Price and volume data
- Metadata and contextual information
- Signal scoring and ranking

### Value Objects

#### ScanCriteria
Defines scan execution parameters:
- Scan type configuration
- Filtering criteria and thresholds
- Parameter validation and business rules

#### SignalThresholds
Controls signal generation quality:
- Minimum confidence requirements
- Strength score thresholds
- Signal limits and cooldown periods

#### ScanConfiguration
Complete scan setup parameters:
- Timeframes and market conditions
- Filtering and threshold settings
- Execution constraints and limits

## Repository Interfaces

### ScanRepository
Data access interface for scan operations:
- CRUD operations for scans and signals
- Query by status, type, and performance
- Execution statistics and trends
- Success rate analysis

### RuleRepository
Data access interface for scanning rules:
- CRUD operations for rules and logic
- Query by type, status, and performance
- Rule usage statistics and optimization
- Performance metrics tracking

## Domain Services

### ScanExecutionService
Handles scan orchestration and execution:
- Scan validation and setup
- Rule execution against market data
- Signal generation and filtering
- Performance tracking and optimization

## Business Rules

1. **Scan Validation**: All scans must have valid criteria and parameters
2. **Signal Quality**: Signals must meet minimum confidence and strength thresholds
3. **Rule Performance**: Rules are continuously evaluated and optimized
4. **Resource Limits**: Scan execution respects time and resource constraints
5. **Market Conditions**: Scans adapt to current market conditions and volatility

## Scan Types

### Breakout Scanning
- Identifies price breakouts above resistance levels
- Volume confirmation and momentum analysis
- False breakout filtering
- Breakout strength measurement

### Consolidation Scanning
- Detects price consolidation patterns
- Volume analysis during consolidation
- Breakout potential assessment
- Pattern completion recognition

### Trend Scanning
- Trend direction and strength analysis
- Trend continuation vs reversal signals
- Moving average alignments
- Trend exhaustion detection

### Volume Scanning
- Unusual volume pattern detection
- Volume spikes and surges
- Volume-price analysis
- Accumulation/distribution patterns

### Momentum Scanning
- Momentum indicator analysis
- Divergence detection
- Overbought/oversold conditions
- Momentum reversal signals

### Reversal Scanning
- Trend reversal pattern recognition
- Support/resistance level analysis
- Volume confirmation for reversals
- Reversal signal validation

## Signal Generation Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather market data for scanning period
2. **Rule Application**: Execute active rules against market data
3. **Signal Creation**: Generate signals from rule matches
4. **Quality Filtering**: Apply confidence and strength thresholds
5. **Signal Ranking**: Sort signals by quality and priority
6. **Result Compilation**: Package signals for downstream processing

## Integration Points

- **Market Data**: Receives real-time and historical price data
- **Analytics**: Uses technical indicators for signal generation
- **Trading**: Provides signals for order generation and execution
- **Risk Management**: Applies risk filters to generated signals
- **Reporting**: Generates scan performance reports and analytics

## Usage Examples

### Creating and Executing a Scan

```python
from domain.scanning import Scan, ScanId, ScanType, ScanCriteria
from domain.scanning.services import ScanExecutionService

# Create scan criteria
criteria = ScanCriteria(
    scan_type=ScanType.BREAKOUT,
    parameters={
        'timeframe': '1h',
        'min_volume': 100000,
        'min_price_change': 2.0
    }
)

# Create scan
scan = Scan(
    id=ScanId.generate(),
    name=ScanName("Morning Breakout Scan"),
    criteria=criteria
)

# Execute scan
execution_service = ScanExecutionService(scan_repo, rule_repo)
completed_scan = execution_service.execute_scan(scan)

# Access results
signals = completed_scan.get_buy_signals()
for signal in signals:
    print(f"{signal.symbol}: {signal.signal_type} @ {signal.price}")
```

### Creating a Custom Rule

```python
from domain.scanning import Rule, RuleId, RuleType, RuleLogic
from domain.scanning.entities.rule import RuleLogic

# Define rule logic
logic = RuleLogic(
    conditions=[
        {
            'type': 'price_change',
            'operator': 'greater_than',
            'value': 2.0,
            'field': 'price_change_pct'
        },
        {
            'type': 'volume',
            'operator': 'greater_than',
            'value': 1.5,
            'field': 'volume_multiplier'
        }
    ],
    actions=[
        {
            'type': 'generate_signal',
            'signal_type': 'BUY',
            'confidence': 0.8,
            'strength': 'STRONG'
        }
    ]
)

# Create rule
rule = Rule(
    id=RuleId.generate(),
    name=RuleName("Volume Breakout Rule"),
    rule_type=RuleType.BREAKOUT,
    logic=logic
)
```

### Signal Processing and Filtering

```python
# Get signals from scan
all_signals = completed_scan.signals

# Filter high-confidence signals
high_conf_signals = [s for s in all_signals if s.is_strong_signal()]

# Sort by signal score
ranked_signals = sorted(high_conf_signals, key=lambda s: s.get_signal_score(), reverse=True)

# Take top signals
top_signals = ranked_signals[:10]
```
