# Broker Integration Domain

## Overview

The Broker Integration domain provides a unified interface for connecting to and interacting with multiple broker APIs. It handles authentication, order execution, account management, and real-time data streaming while maintaining domain integrity and providing a consistent API across different broker implementations.

## Domain Components

### Entities

- **BrokerConnection**: Represents a connection to a specific broker with authentication and session management
- **BrokerAccount**: Represents a trading account with balance, margin, and position information

### Value Objects

- **ExecutionParameters**: Defines order execution parameters (time-in-force, routing, algorithms)
- **BrokerOrder**: Represents an order in broker-specific format
- **ExecutionReport**: Contains details of order execution and fills
- **OrderStatusUpdate**: Tracks order status changes over time
- **BrokerCapabilities**: Defines what features a broker supports

### Repositories

- **BrokerConnectionRepository**: Manages broker connection persistence
- **BrokerAccountRepository**: Manages account information persistence
- **OrderExecutionRepository**: Manages order data persistence
- **ExecutionReportRepository**: Manages execution report persistence
- **OrderStatusRepository**: Manages order status history persistence

### Services

- **BrokerConnectionManager**: Handles connection lifecycle and authentication
- **OrderExecutionManager**: Manages order submission, monitoring, and execution

## Key Features

### Connection Management
- Multi-broker support with unified API
- Automatic authentication and session management
- Connection health monitoring and automatic recovery
- Support for different authentication methods (API keys, OAuth, etc.)

### Order Execution
- Support for various order types (market, limit, stop, stop-limit, trailing stop)
- Smart order routing based on order characteristics
- Real-time execution monitoring and anomaly detection
- Commission and fee tracking

### Account Management
- Multi-account support per broker connection
- Real-time balance and position tracking
- Margin and buying power calculations
- Account type management (cash, margin, retirement, etc.)

### Execution Monitoring
- Real-time order status tracking
- Execution anomaly detection
- Performance metrics calculation
- Automated alerts for execution issues

## Usage Examples

### Establishing a Broker Connection

```python
from domain.broker_integration import BrokerConnectionManager, ConnectionCredentials

# Create connection manager
connection_manager = BrokerConnectionManager(connection_repository)

# Create connection credentials
credentials = ConnectionCredentials(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    api_secret="your_api_secret",
    access_token="your_access_token"
)

# Establish connection
success = await connection_manager.establish_connection("connection_id")
```

### Submitting an Order

```python
from domain.broker_integration import OrderExecutionManager, BrokerOrder, ExecutionParameters

# Create order execution manager
order_manager = OrderExecutionManager(
    order_repository, execution_repository, status_repository, connection_repository
)

# Create order
order = BrokerOrder(
    broker_order_id="order_123",
    symbol="AAPL",
    side="BUY",
    quantity=100,
    order_type="LIMIT",
    price=Decimal("150.00"),
    execution_params=ExecutionParameters(time_in_force="DAY")
)

# Submit order
result = await order_manager.submit_order(order)
```

### Monitoring Order Status

```python
# Get order status
status = await order_manager.get_order_status("order_123")

# Get execution history
executions = await order_manager.get_execution_history("order_123")

# Get execution metrics
metrics = await order_manager.get_execution_metrics("order_123")
```

## Domain Rules

1. **Connection Integrity**: Each broker connection must be authenticated before use
2. **Order Validation**: All orders must be validated before submission
3. **Status Consistency**: Order status must be maintained consistently across all components
4. **Execution Tracking**: Every order execution must be recorded with complete details
5. **Error Handling**: Connection and execution errors must be handled gracefully with automatic recovery

## Architecture Principles

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation of domain logic from infrastructure
- **Dependency Inversion**: Domain depends on abstractions, not implementations
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Open/Closed**: Components are open for extension but closed for modification

## Testing

The domain includes comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Entity creation and validation
- Value object immutability and business rules
- Repository operations and data persistence
- Service business logic and error handling
- Integration scenarios and edge cases

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional order types (bracket orders, OCO, etc.)
- Advanced routing algorithms based on market conditions
- Real-time risk management integration
- Multi-asset class support (options, futures, forex)
- Machine learning-based execution optimization
