# Principles

Spec-Driven
- Define specs and designs before code; no "vibe coding".

Agentic Reasoning
- Plan → Act → Observe → Reflect loop for multi-step tasks.

Local Environment Integration
- Execute locally; integrate with editors, test runners, and DB; preserve privacy.

Traceability
- Every action logged as a diff tied to a task and spec; reviewable history.
