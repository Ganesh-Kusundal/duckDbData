# 3) Task-Based Implementation

Purpose: Break the design into sequential, auditable tasks with tests.

Task Card Template
- Title: <concise task>
- Description: what and why
- Dependencies: upstream tasks or artifacts
- Changes: files/modules to touch
- Tests: unit + integration (what to add/modify)
- Definition of Done: measurable checks

Backlog to Execution
- Order tasks by dependency and value.
- Keep tasks small (1â€“2 hours each) for clear diffs.
- Prepare tests alongside code changes.

Artifacts
- templates/task.md (one per task)
