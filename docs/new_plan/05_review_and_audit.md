# 5) Review and Audit

Review Flow
- Kiro surfaces a diff for each task step.
- Reviewer checks spec/design alignment, tests, and boundaries.
- Approve or request changes; merge only after tests pass.

Audit Trail
- Diffs + task cards + links to specs/designs create traceability.
- Steering notes capture decisions and preferences across sessions.
