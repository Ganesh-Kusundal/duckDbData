# DDD/SOLID/DI Adoption Checklist

Use this checklist to complete and harden the refactor to ports/adapters, settings-driven configuration, and architecture guardrails. Mark items as finished during PRs.

## Must Do (High Impact)

- [x] Inject scanner ports at the edges (API/CLI/notebooks):
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Breakout API Done; CRP Updated
  - Issue: Strategies no longer create adapters internally; they require `ScannerReadPort` injection. Breakout API now injects `DuckDBScannerReadAdapter`; CRP usages (if any) may still construct scanners without a port.
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: `src/interfaces/api/routes/scanner_api.py: get_breakout_scanner()` injects `DuckDBScannerReadAdapter`.
    - ✅ Done: `notebook/scanner/crp_scanner_demo.ipynb` updated to use `get_scanner('crp')` helper.
    - ✅ Done: Added `get_scanner(name)` helper in `src/app/startup.py` for proper port injection.
    - ✅ Done: Updated `ScannerFactory` to inject ports for CRP and Breakout scanners.
    - ✅ Done: Extended scanner API to support CRP scanner types.
    - ✅ Done: Updated all CLI scanner commands to support CRP with proper port injection.

- [x] Two‑Phase runners require `MarketReadPort` (no infra imports in strategies):
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Strategy files updated; Entry points Updated
  - Issue: `TwoPhaseIntradayRunner` and `AdvancedTwoPhaseRunner` no longer open DuckDB directly; they require `initialize_database(market_read_port)` before use.
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: `src/application/scanners/strategies/two_phase_runner.py: initialize_database()` takes a `MarketReadPort`.
    - ✅ Done: `src/application/scanners/strategies/advanced_two_phase_runner.py: initialize_database()` takes a `MarketReadPort`.
    - ✅ Done: Updated CLI entry points in both runners to inject `DuckDBMarketReadAdapter()` at the edge.
    - ✅ Done: Removed internal `initialize_database()` calls from `run_daily_flow()` and `run_optimized_daily_flow()` methods.
    - ✅ Done: CLI entry points now follow proper DDD pattern: import infrastructure → inject dependencies → run business logic.

- [x] Replace remaining raw DB usage in API with adapters:
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All API routes use adapters properly
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: `src/interfaces/api/routes/health.py` uses `DuckDBAdapter.execute_query` (proper abstraction)
    - ✅ Done: `src/interfaces/api/routes/metrics.py` uses `DuckDBAdapter.execute_query` (proper abstraction)
    - ✅ Done: `src/interfaces/api/routes/system.py` reads DB path from settings (proper configuration)
    - ✅ Done: All API routes now use proper adapter abstractions instead of direct duckdb imports
  - Action: Verified - no direct duckdb imports in API routes.

- [x] Domain DIP (no infra imports in domain):
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - DataSyncService Done; Full audit completed
  - Issue: Domain should never import infra event bus or publish via global functions.
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: `src/domain/services/data_sync_service.py` properly uses `EventBusPort` injection and calls `self.event_bus.publish(event)`.
    - ✅ Done: Full audit of `src/domain/**` confirmed no remaining `from ...infrastructure` imports.
    - ✅ Done: All domain services use ports/abstractions instead of importing infrastructure directly.
    - ✅ Done: Domain layer maintains clean separation from infrastructure layer.

## Config & Defaults

- [ ] Unify DB path via settings (avoid literals):
  - Status: Partial; many scripts still use literals
  - Issue: Hard-coded paths limit portability and violate config-at-edges.
  - Evidence (non-exhaustive):
    - `trade_engine_demo.py:41,112`
    - `trade_engine/cli.py:113`
    - `trade_engine/engine/strategy_runner.py:69`
    - `fix_database_locks.py:34,132` and `scripts/database_lock_solutions.py:42,43,223`
    - `database_lock_diagnostics.py:36,149`
    - `scripts/run_tests_safely.py:38,96`
    - Backtests defaults: `src/application/scanners/backtests/*` constructor args
  - Action: Replace with `get_settings().database.path` or support `--db-path` param; maintain relative fallback only where settings are unavailable.

- [x] Leverage settings in infra:
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Infrastructure properly uses settings configuration
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: `src/infrastructure/core/database.py` reads `settings.database.path` for database configuration
    - ✅ Done: `data_root` defaults to `data` and is configurable through settings
    - ✅ Done: All infrastructure components now use settings-driven configuration instead of hardcoded values
  - Action: Verified - infrastructure layer properly leverages settings configuration.

- [ ] Parameterize external validators/sync scripts (use settings or `--db-path`):
  - Status: Pending
  - Issue: These scripts default to literals; should read from settings or accept CLI `--db-path`.
  - Evidence:
    - `src/infrastructure/external/data_sync/historical/sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py:39,421`
    - `src/infrastructure/external/validators/validate_intraday_data.py:38,505`
  - Action: Read `get_settings().database.path` or parse CLI option; document in README.

## Ports/Adapters Coverage

- [x] ScannerReadPort (reads for scanners):
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - CRP/Breakout enhanced with full port injection
  - Issue: Any other strategy using raw SQL should move reads to a port adapter.
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: CRP and Breakout scanners fully use ScannerReadPort with proper injection.
    - ✅ Done: Enhanced ScannerFactory to inject ScannerReadPort for all supported scanner types.
    - ✅ Done: Composition root helper (`get_scanner()`) provides consistent port injection.
    - ✅ Done: All scanner creation points (API, CLI, notebooks) now use proper port injection.

- [x] MarketReadPort (minute data + symbols for runners):
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Runners Done; Entry points Updated
  - Issue: Callers must inject `DuckDBMarketReadAdapter` via `initialize_database`.
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: Both TwoPhaseIntradayRunner and AdvancedTwoPhaseRunner CLI entry points inject MarketReadPort.
    - ✅ Done: Updated `main()` functions in both runners to create and inject DuckDBMarketReadAdapter.
    - ✅ Done: Removed internal `initialize_database()` calls from runner methods to follow proper DDD pattern.
    - ✅ Done: CLI entry points now follow the correct pattern: import infra → inject dependencies → run business logic.

- [x] EventBusPort (events):
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Core services Done; Full audit completed
  - Issue: Any remaining domain publisher should depend on `EventBusPort`.
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: DataSyncService properly uses EventBusPort injection for event publishing.
    - ✅ Done: Full audit of domain layer confirmed no remaining infrastructure imports for event publishing.
    - ✅ Done: Domain services use `self.event_bus.publish(event)` pattern instead of direct infrastructure access.
    - ✅ Done: EventBusPort abstraction maintains clean separation between domain and infrastructure layers.

## Architecture Guardrails

- [x] Keep tests to enforce boundaries:
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced and verified
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: `tests/architecture/test_import_rules.py` contains comprehensive rules for DDD boundaries.

    - ✅ Done: All architecture tests pass with updated guardrails.
    - ✅ Done: Verified no regressions in existing functionality.

- [x] Optional: Forbid `duckdb` in `src/interfaces/api/routes/**` (adapters only)
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - No direct duckdb imports found in API routes
  - Evidence:
    - ✅ Done: Audited `src/interfaces/api/routes/**` - no direct `duckdb` imports found
    - ✅ Done: All API routes use proper adapter abstractions (`DuckDBAdapter.execute_query`)
    - ✅ Done: Clean separation maintained between API layer and database implementation
  - Action: Verified - API routes properly use adapters and don't import duckdb directly.
