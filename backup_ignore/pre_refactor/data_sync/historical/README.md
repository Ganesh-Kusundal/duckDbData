### Integration with Existing Codebase

This script is designed to work seamlessly with the existing codebase:
- Uses the same broker interface as `broker/test_broker_historical_data.py`
- Integrates with the DuckDB infrastructure
- Follows the same data storage conventions
- Compatible with existing data processing pipelines

### Based On

This script is based on `broker/test_broker_historical_data.py` and extends its functionality for automated data syncing.
# Historical Data Sync Scripts

This directory contains scripts for syncing historical market data from brokers to local storage.

## sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py

**PRIMARY SCRIPT** - A comprehensive script to sync today's 1-minute intraday data for all available symbols from the broker directly into DuckDB.

### Features

- ✅ **Automatic Symbol Discovery**: Gets ALL available symbols from DuckDB database
- ✅ **Today's Intraday Data Only**: Fetches 1-minute intraday data for today (no historical fallback)
- ✅ **Direct DuckDB Insertion**: Inserts data directly into DuckDB with perfect duplicate prevention
- ✅ **Zero Duplicates**: Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicate records
- ✅ **1-Minute Granularity**: Stores actual 1-minute OHLCV data (not aggregated)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Continues processing even if individual symbols fail
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging and progress updates for large symbol sets
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Handles the entire symbol universe (487+ symbols)

### Usage

#### Basic Usage (ALL SYMBOLS)
```bash
# Sync today's intraday data for ALL available symbols from DuckDB
python data_sync/historical/sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py

# Or run directly (if executable)
./data_sync/historical/sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py
```

#### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Sync specific symbols only
python data_sync/historical/sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py --symbols RELIANCE TCS HDFCBANK

# Limit number of symbols to process (for testing)
python data_sync/historical/sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py --max-symbols 50

# Custom database path
python data_sync/historical/sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py --db-path /path/to/database.duckdb

# Debug logging
python data_sync/historical/sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Production Usage
```bash
# Run for all symbols (recommended for production)
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/project python data_sync/historical/sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py

# Or with nohup for background processing
nohup python data_sync/historical/sync_today_intraday_duckdb.py > sync_log.txt 2>&1 &
```

### Command Line Options

- `--symbols`: Specific symbols to sync (space-separated)
- `--max-symbols`: Maximum number of symbols to process
- `--db-path`: Path to DuckDB database file (default: data/financial_data.duckdb)
- `--log-level`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Connects to DuckDB and broker
2. **Symbol Discovery**: Gets ALL available symbols from database (`get_available_symbols()`)
3. **Intraday Data Fetching**: For each symbol, fetches today's 1-minute intraday data from broker
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Checks existing data in DuckDB to identify missing timestamps
5. **Smart Insertion**: Inserts only missing 1-minute records using `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
6. **Progress Reporting**: Provides detailed statistics and error reporting

### Key Technical Features

- ✅ **Intraday Focus**: Uses `get_intraday_data(symbol, "NSE", 1)` for 1-minute data
- ✅ **Today's Data Only**: Filters broker response to today's date only
- ✅ **Perfect Deduplication**: Compares timestamps before insertion
- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Handles large symbol sets efficiently
- ✅ **Error Resilience**: Continues processing on individual symbol failures

### Database Integration

**Data Structure in DuckDB:**
```sql
SELECT symbol, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume
FROM market_data
WHERE date_partition = CURRENT_DATE AND symbol = 'RELIANCE'
ORDER BY timestamp
LIMIT 5;
```

**Result:**
```
symbol    timestamp           open    high    low     close   volume
RELIANCE  2025-09-05 09:15:00  1363.0  1367.9  1363.0  1367.3  93225
RELIANCE  2025-09-05 09:16:00  1367.3  1368.5  1366.0  1367.8  65432
RELIANCE  2025-09-05 09:17:00  1367.8  1369.2  1367.0  1368.9  48765
...
```

### Dependencies

- pandas
- duckdb
- broker package (Dhan integration)
- pathlib
- logging

### Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling:
- Broker connection failures
- Individual symbol data fetch failures
- Database insertion errors
- Network timeouts
- Invalid data formats

Failed symbols are logged and the script continues processing remaining symbols.

### Logging

The script provides detailed logging including:
- Connection status
- Processing progress (every 10 symbols)
- Success/failure counts
- Duplicate detection results
- Performance statistics
- Final summary with rates
