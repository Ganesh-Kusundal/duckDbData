## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Support/Resistance Analysis Engine**

```python
# Multi-level support analysis
support_level_1 = historical_strong_support    # Primary support
support_level_2 = support_level_1 * 0.97      # Secondary support  
support_level_3 = support_level_1 * 0.94      # Tertiary support

# Strength-based scoring
support_proximity_score = np.where(
    (closest_support_distance <= 2.0) & (support_strength >= 4),
    100,  # Perfect score for tight proximity to strong support
    75    # Good score for close proximity to decent support
)
```

### **Supply/Demand Zone Detection**

```python
# Supply zones (selling pressure areas)
supply_zone_high = session_high
supply_zone_low = session_high * 0.985  # 1.5% zone width
supply_zone_strength = strength_rating  # 1-5 scale

# Zone interaction analysis
in_supply_zone = (
    (current_price >= supply_zone_low) & 
    (current_price <= supply_zone_high)
)
```

### **Level Proximity Scoring System**

```python
# Distance-based scoring with strength weighting
level_proximity_score = (
    level_proximity_base * 0.40 +      # 40% - Distance to levels
    zone_interaction * 0.25 +          # 25% - Zone analysis  
    volume_confirmation * 0.20 +       # 20% - Volume at levels
    price_action_quality * 0.15        # 15% - Price reaction
)
```

## 🔍 **Signal Classification System**

### **Support/Resistance Signals:**

#### **🔄 SUPPORT_BOUNCE**
- Price bouncing from strong support levels
- Requires: Support proximity ≤2%, strength ≥3, bullish momentum, volume confirmation

#### **⛔ RESISTANCE_REJECTION**  
- Price rejecting from strong resistance levels
- Requires: Resistance proximity ≤2%, strength ≥3, bearish momentum, volume confirmation

#### **💥 LEVEL_BREAKOUT**
- Price breaking through key levels with volume
- Requires: Price above/below level + momentum ≥1% + volume ≥2.5x

#### **🎯 ZONE_PLAY**
- Price action within supply/demand zones
- Requires: Inside zone + momentum ≥0.8% + volume ≥1.5x

#### **💎 HIGH_PROBABILITY**
- Multiple technical confirmations
- Requires: Level score >80 + Volume score >70 + Price action score >80

## 📊 **Integration Architecture**

### **Data Flow:**
```
Historical Data → Level Calculation → Zone Detection → Proximity Analysis → Scoring → Signal Classification
```

### **Scoring Weights:**
```
Level Proximity Score (40%) - Distance to S/R levels with strength weighting
Zone Analysis Score (25%) - Supply/demand zone interaction  
Volume Confirmation (20%) - Volume at key levels
Price Action Score (15%) - Quality of price reaction at levels
```

### **Real-Time Integration Path:**
```python
# Load from your technical indicators storage
from core.technical_indicators.storage import TechnicalIndicatorsStorage

storage = TechnicalIndicatorsStorage('data/technical_indicators')
indicators = storage.load_indicators(symbol, '5T', scan_date, scan_date)

# Access S/R levels
support_1 = indicators['support_level_1'].iloc[-1]
resistance_1 = indicators['resistance_level_1'].iloc[-1]
supply_zone_high = indicators['supply_zone_high'].iloc[-1]
demand_zone_low = indicators['demand_zone_low'].iloc[-1]
```
