### 3. **Advanced Signal Classification**

| Signal Type | Criteria | Expected Performance |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| **STRONG_BULLISH** 🚀 | >2% move + >3x volume + low risk | High probability top gainer |
| **STRONG_BEARISH** 💥 | <-2% move + >3x volume | High probability top decliner |
| **BREAKOUT** ⚡ | >2.5% move + >3.5x volume + high volatility | Explosive momentum |
| **QUALITY** 💎 | Score >60 + consistent volume + good risk | Reliable opportunity |
| **MODERATE** 📊 | Standard momentum signals | Moderate opportunity |

### 4. **Risk Management Integration**
- **Downside Risk Assessment:** Track maximum downside by 09:50
- **Risk-Adjusted Scoring:** Reduce scores for high-risk setups
- **Quality Filters:** Multiple consistency checks

### 5. **Enhanced Metrics & Analysis**
